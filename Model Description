bert-base-NER is a fine-tuned BERT model that is ready to use for Named Entity Recognition and achieves state-of-the-art performance for the NER task.
It has been trained to recognize four types of entities: location (LOC), organizations (ORG), person (PER) and Miscellaneous (MISC).
Specifically, this model is a bert-base-cased model that was fine-tuned on the English version of the standard CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition dataset.
If you'd like to use a larger BERT-large model fine-tuned on the same dataset, a bert-large-NER version is also available.
